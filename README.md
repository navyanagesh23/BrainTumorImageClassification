# BrainTumorImageClassification

Executed a solo initiative focusing on Brain Tumor Image Classification using
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for precise medical diagnostics. Applied
advanced deep learning techniques to construct an efficient model for accurate
tumor detection. Showcasing proficiency in Python and TensorFlow. Achieved
notable success in optimizing CNN architectures, underscoring my independent
problem-solving skills and commitment to leveraging artificial intelligence for
impactful solutions in the healthcare domain. This project stands as a testament
to my self-driven approach and technical expertise in the realm of medical
image analysis
